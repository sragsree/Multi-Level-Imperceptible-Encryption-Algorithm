# Multi-Level Imperceptible Encryption Algorithm

A MATLAB based project that includes a comparative study of the existig encryption algorithms namely

  - Least Significant Bit coding.
  - Parity coding.
  - Phase coding.
  - Spread Spectrum coding
  - Echo coding.
  
 and the development of a multi-level imperceptible encryption algorithm that is superior to all the above algorithms in terms of Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR). This new algorithm was proved to enhance the performance of computers that works in a network that deals with a lot of encrypted data.

### Installation

### Usage

```
fplot(@sin,[-2*pi 2*pi])
grid on
title('sin(x) from -2\pi to 2\pi')
xlabel('x');
ylabel('y');
```
